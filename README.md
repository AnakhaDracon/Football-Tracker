# Football-Tracker
My football tracker phone app.

This is an app to track football officials when watching a game. 
Development with Android Studio.

Basically, I am a football official and at times I get the opporitunity to observe games. 
What I want to be able to do is track what is happening during the game and then export that to a file 
so when I am reviewing the game film, I have a record of everything.

For example, I track that a foul happened on a certain play and I want to see what the official saw.
I load up the game film and my game data and see exactly what was seen and called.
